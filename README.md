# 🔍 figma-watchdog

**figma-watchdog** is an open-source tool that compares design specs from a Figma file to the layout of a live web page in production. It aims to detect **design drift**, layout inconsistencies, and implementation mismatches automatically—making it easier to catch visual or structural bugs early in your deployment pipeline.

> ⚠️ This project is an early-stage **work in progress**. In the future, it will leverage **AI** to perform smarter, more semantic comparisons between design and production.

## 🎯 What Problem Does It Solve?

As products evolve, the UI often strays from the original design due to:
- Incremental UI changes
- Bug fixes that break alignment
- Inconsistent implementation across teams

This phenomenon is called **design drift**—where the production UI no longer accurately reflects the intended design in Figma. `figma-watchdog` helps catch and prevent this automatically.

## ✅ Key Benefits

- **Catch visual bugs early**: Run as part of nightly tests or CI to flag broken layouts before they hit production.
- **Prevent design drift**: Enforce alignment with your design system and keep engineering + design in sync.
- **Lightweight + fast**: Uses DOM and layout data, not full pixel diffs.
- **Extensible for AI**: Future versions will analyze semantic intent, not just raw dimensions.

## 🧰 How It Works (Current MVP)

1. **Pull design data from Figma**
   - Uses the Figma REST API to fetch layout metadata (bounding boxes, names, etc.)

2. **Load and inspect live DOM**
   - Uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) to load a real page and extract element layout

3. **Compare elements**
   - Matches each Figma node (by name) to a DOM element (via CSS selector)
   - Compares bounding boxes, text content, and dimensions with tolerances

4. **Report mismatches**
   - Outputs a list of layout/content differences
   - Intended to fail CI if significant discrepancies are found

## 🧠 Future Plans

This project will evolve to include:

- 🤖 **AI-assisted comparison** using vision-language models or layout transformers
- 🧩 Automatic Figma-to-DOM element matching
- 📸 Visual diff reports with overlays
- 🔔 Slack / GitHub alert integration
- 🧪 Testing Figma variants (e.g., dark/light mode or responsive layouts)
